# glioma-cysteine

This repository contains the R code to reproduce the metabolomics results presented in **_Noch et al. "Cysteine induces mitochondrial reductive stress in glioblastoma through hydrogen peroxide production" (2021)_**.

The script **MetabolomicsAnalysis.R** will automatically download the raw metabolomics data from [Figshare](https://10.6084/m9.figshare.16520268) and run the differential analysis as presented in the manuscript.
The code will generate an html file (_Glioma_GradeDifferentialAnalysis_CysteinePathway.html_) and an Excel file (_DifferentialAnalysisResults.xlsx_), which will include detailed reporting of all preprocessing and statistical analysis steps.
